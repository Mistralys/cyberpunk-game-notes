# Cyberpunk Game Notes

Modding notes for Cyberpunk 2077

## Body mods

### Solo Original

Issue: the mod does not want to be loaded from Vortex' `Cyberpunk 2077/mods` folder when installing via Vortex.

1. Install via Vortex
2. Open the game mods folder after deploying
3. Copy the `.archive` file to `Cyberpunk 2077/archive/pc/mod`

> NOTE: Leave the Vortex folder intact, that way it stays visible.
> Best to add a note to remember to remove the archive manually
> on uninstall.
